# Hyppo Source API

This API is used by hyppo data ingestion integrations. It has minimal dependencies itself and is the only
required depdency that integrations must have in order to function.

All other choices of library, JVM language (scala, clujure, kotlin, etc) are available to the integration
implementation.
